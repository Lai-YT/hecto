    Hecto is a basic text editor,
    <br>
    re-implemented in Rust based on the original <a href="http://antirez.com/news/108">kilo</a> editor,
    <br>
    as outlined in <a href="https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html">Build Your Own Text Editor</a>.
</p>

This project serves as an exercise for me to learn Rust, following the blog post [Hecto: Build your own text editor in Rust](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/) with minor modifications.
